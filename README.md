  a computer system. On the other hand, a Database Management System (DBMS)
  is a complex set of software programs that controls the organization, storage,
  management, and retrieval of data in a database. DBMS are categorized
  according to their data structures or types. The DBMS accepts requests for data
  from the application program and instructs the operating system to transfer the
  appropriate data.
